## üåç **Context**

The foundation is entirely run by volunteers and lacks salaried staff. Over time, the internal management has relied on a variety of tools and workflows familiar to individual volunteers, leading to a fragmented and labor-intensive system.

This application addresses the following issues:
- Centralizing tools to simplify internal operations.
- Reducing manual effort through automation.
- Ensuring tasks are easy to understand and delegate.

## ‚ú® **Features**

### **Fund Management**
- Manage virtual funds, including:
    - General fund
    - Operational fund
    - Specific funds for collectives/associations
- Support fund creation, closure, and inter-fund transfers.

### **Donation Tracking**
- Import and process bank statements (CSV format) to track donations.
- Avoid duplicate transactions during CSV imports.
- Enable manual donation entries for offline contributions.

### **Anonymity & Privacy**
- Anonymize donor information to ensure confidentiality.
- Process CSV data in-memory without saving sensitive details.

### **Automation Strategies**
- Auto-classify donations using:
    - Recognized bank account numbers.
    - Frequent banking references (e.g., project-specific tags).
- Manual review for ambiguous or unrecognized transactions.

### **Randomized Selection for Decision Committees**
